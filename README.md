20221001- Making a calculator to practice javascript

20221013- got pretty busy after the initial css but had some free time today to finally wire up js to calculator, still some minor bugs to work out but getting there:
    -need to fix overflow of large numbers with decimals
    -need to fix creating a new number after hitting equals button
    -add error for diving by zero
    -surely other things as well
